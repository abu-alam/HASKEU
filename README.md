The following external libraries have been used for the implementation of HASKEU:

1. reactive-banana : a practical library for functional reactive programming
2. wxHaskell : wxHaskell is a portable and native GUI library for Haskell
3. reactive-banana-wx : provides some GUI examples for the reactive-banana
library, using wxHaskell 
4. haskell-src-exts : a suite of annotable datatypes describing the abstract
syntax of Haskell 
5. haskell-type-exts : a type checker for Haskell as embodied syntactically
by the haskell-src-exts
